# stockchecking-example
An example of a "stock-checker" bot that checks for a product's stock and informs the user through telegram.

## Rationale
I wanted to buy the Apple Watch 8, its on sale since AW9 is out. Machines (an Apple Distributor in MY) is selling it with a great deal. However stocks are scarce.
In store is not available anymore, but online has stocks but are limited and sometimes appear randomly. The "Notify me when available" button is, and will always be, useless.

Using this I succeeded in securing one, and it will still be within the realm of ethical (I'm not botting to buy, I'm botting to notify)

So here it is, use it as a skeleton for your stock-check logic or whatever it is you need it for. Code is done in a short span of time, don't expect much pls.
